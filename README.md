This project is developed to help the community to learn C or C++ on the go.

You can use this app to code and compile C/C++ project without Internet.


## Features
- Offline C compiler
- Offline C++ compiler
- Native activity, SDL2 support for GUI
- Build executables file, export your program
- Make 4.0, makefile support, you can build as on your PC
- Static code analysis, it helps you to fix "difficult" bugs:
    1. memory leaks
    1. mismatching allocation and deallocation
    1. uninitialized variables usage
    1. array index out of bounds errors
- C/C++ code formatter
- Terminal emulator: full-featured terminal
- Git, svn support (Install by use Intall plugin features)
- Diagnostic utility: auto jump to error position
- Compiler output: See stdout, stderr
- Syntax highlighting: C/C++ language and very more language (only highlight without compile)

- File manager
- Multi Tab: you can open different files in different tabs to manage editing multiple files simultaneously with ease.
- Easy toolbar: you can quickly create a new file, open, save, save as, undo/redo, insert some commonly used symbols, go back to last edit location, etc.

## How to use SDL, NativeActivity?
You need install SDL Plugin for CPP N-IDE and open it once time to install libraries.
The application will be auto detect linker flags (LDFLAGS) for your source file

## How to use makefile?
1. Write your makefile
2. Open terminal and type "make"

## How to install libraries
1. Open drawer then click "Install libraries/Plugin"
2. Find your prebuilt libraries your need

Currently, I supported commom libraries such as curl, CLooG, dropbear, expat, fontconfig, freetype, glib, gmp, isl, conv, pcre, png, uuid, mpc, mpfr, ncurses, openssl, ppl


## Android install
- For arm devices: download ``app-arch_arm7-release.apk`` in release
- For x86 devices: download ``app-arch_x86-release.apk`` in release

## TODO
- Code completion
- Real-time diagnostics (warnings, errors) and suggestion to fix it
- Static code analysis
- Git support

## Pull request always welcomed.
