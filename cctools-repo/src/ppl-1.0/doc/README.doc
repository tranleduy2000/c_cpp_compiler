How To Get (More) PPL Documentation
===================================

Do you have all the documentation you need? If you don't or if you are
unsure, the following is for you.

There are two versions of the Parma Polyhedra Library's documentation:

  + a `user' manual, containing all and only the information needed by
    people wishing to use the library;
  + a `devref' (developer reference) manual, also containing details
    about the library implementation.

Each of these versions can be obtained in several formats:

  + a PDF file suitable for browsing on the screen;
  + a (gzipped) PostScript file suitable for printing;
  + a (tarred and gzipped) collection of HTML pages suitable for browsing.


The Documentation You May Already Have
======================================

First of all, you may already have some documentation and all you need
to do is to find it.

If you have downloaded a source (tar or zip) archive for PPL version
X.Y.Z, you will find in the doc subdirectory the following set of user
manuals:

  ppl-user-X.Y.Z.pdf
  ppl-user-X.Y.Z.ps.gz

If you have installed a binary RPM package, then you have the same set
of manuals. You can find them with the command `rpm -ql ppl' which
will print, among other things, something like

  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z
  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z/README
  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z/ppl-user-X.Y.Z.pdf
  /usr/share/doc/ppl-X.Y.Z/ppl-user-X.Y.Z.ps.gz


The Documentation You May Download
==================================

If you are using the latest released version of the library, you will
find all the documentation in all formats at
http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/Documentation/ .


The Documentation You May Build Yourself
========================================

When all else fails (which is the case, for example, when you are
using a Git version [1]) then you may build the documentation by
yourself. In order to do that, you should have a recent version of
Doxygen [2] and, if you want to build the HTML documentation, a recent
version of Graphviz [3].  When you have all the tools installed and
running, you should follow the following procedure.

First, you should determine which version of the library you are
working with. The safest way is to go to the top source directory of
the library and to locate the unique line in the file configure.ac
containing the string "AC_INIT". This will look like

  AC_INIT([the Parma Polyhedra Library], 0.6.3pre4, ppl-devel@cs.unipr.it, ppl)

from which you determine that the version is 0.6.3pre4 (a.k.a. the 4th
beta version before release 0.6.3).

Then, if you have not yet done it, build the library itself (see the
building instructions in the file INSTALL [4] in the top source
directory.  The default build process, while essential in order to
produce the documentation, will not generate it directly. For this
reason you should go to the doc subdirectory of your build directory
(i.e., the one where you compiled the library) and build all the
documents you want by executing a command of the form

  make doc1 doc2 ...

Here, doc1, doc2 and so forth are the names of the documents to be built.
Document names may be obtained from the following list by replacing
X.Y.Z with the version number you have already determined, and by
replacing KIND with either `user' or `devref':

  ppl-KIND-X.Y.Z.pdf
  ppl-KIND-X.Y.Z.ps.gz
  ppl-KIND-X.Y.Z-html.tar.gz

For example, the command

  make ppl-user-0.6.3pre4.pdf ppl-devref-0.6.3pre4.pdf

will build both kinds of manuals in a PDF format.  Alternatively, the
command `make world' will build all the available documentation in all
of the above formats.

It is possible that, while compiling some PostScript or PDF
documentation, TeX dies with a "TeX capacity exceeded" error
message.  The error should contain the indication of the TeX buffer
whose capacity has been exceeded, e.g.:

  ! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [save size=5000].

You then need to edit the TeX configuration file that defines the
buffer sizes so as to increase the value of the relevant buffer.
Note: the actual name and location of the configuration file will vary
depending on the available TeX distribution: possible names include
texmf.cnf, texmf.cfg and 20sizes.cnf.  Continuing our example, we can
double save_size by editing the configuration file so that the
relevant line becomes

  save_size = 10000        % for saving values outside current group

Any change to such configuration files should be followed by running
a command like

  texconfig init

for the change to become effective (on some systems the `texconfig-sys'
command should be used to configure TeX system-wide).
