The PPL developers encourage you to report any bugs you find using the
bug tracking system available at https://www.cs.unipr.it/mantis/ .
Here `bug' should be interpreted in its broadest sense: outright
software errors, misfeatures, bad interfaces, missing or unclear
documentation... whatever is a subject for possible improvement.

As far as software bugs are concerned, the best reports are those that
are reproducible.  Including (or pointing us to) code that exhibits
the reported misbehavior is the best thing you can do to help us fix
the library.  Of course, this is not always possible and we will
welcome any kind of bug report.  Anyway, you may be interested to read
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html on how to report
bugs effectively.

All known bugs were resolved before the release.  It is likely that
there are still bugs in the released version.  Any bugs found after
the release will be listed at http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/Bugs/ .
